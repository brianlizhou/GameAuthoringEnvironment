My discussion with Andrew helped me reaffirm the benefits of the design of our API but also made me consider certain limitations. Firstly, we considered the pros and cons of reusing the Game Object classes from the Game Editor in the Game Engine. The advantage is that the Game Object classes will hold a lot of data that the Game Engine for which the Game Editor needs access. Thus, this implementation will greatly reduce duplicate code. However, there could potentially be some data for which the Game Engine does not need access that we would have to hide in some way. Overall, Andrew and I agreed that the benefits of this implementation outweighed the downsides. In a similar way, I now feel more confident about my decision to use reflection to change the values of instance variables based on their names, which allows for greater flexibility but in a way abuses the power of reflection to access private variables. Lastly, talking to him about his project made me consider how we should keep track of individual Game Objects, which his team is doing through the use of IDs. We discussed how this implementation develops some unwanted assumptions but is also useful for referencing specific Game Objects. While I am not sure exactly the best way to do this, it definitely gave me another idea to consider as I continue with the project.
