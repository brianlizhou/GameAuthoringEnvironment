# Plan - VOOGASalad DreamTeam

### Implementation Plan
+ Basic implementation:
For basic implementations, we want to be able to create Flappy Birds using Game Editor and run it in the Game Engine. We will complete our Use Cases and try to maintain as flexible of a design as possible.


+ Extensions:
For our extensions, we plan on editing an existing game, creating Super Mario and Doodle Jump, being able to run those games, and eventually being able to attempt the more difficult extensions such as multiplayer engine and editing environments.
