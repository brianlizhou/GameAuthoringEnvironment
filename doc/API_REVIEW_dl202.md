### Part 1
* What about your API/design is intended to be flexible? All three of us talked about data-driven design and how nothing will be hard-coded.
* How is your API/design encapsulating your implementation decisions? We discussed different divisions of the project. One of us is splitting it into Authoring Environment and Play environment. Another one of us is doing something similar. We all have some sort of controller class and hierarchy that encapsulates the behavior of our objects and facilitates communication such as data transfer.
* How is your part linked to other parts of the project? For me, I'm working on Integration. my part is connected to the Gallery, Editor, and Engine.
* What exceptions (error cases) might occur in your part and how will you handle them (or not, by throwing)? Error cases we discussed include bad input, erroneously formatted files, and degenerate/unplayable cases in the authoring environment. We would report them through alert messages, and preserve functionality by assigning default values to replace parts where these errors occur.
* Why do you think your API/design is good (also define what your measure of good is)? My API is good because it is flexible and minimizes dependencies. My definition of good is being able to effectively add extensions without having to change a ton of existing code.
### Part 2
* What feature/design problem are you most excited to work on? I'm pretty excited to assist the front end with different portions of their displays, especially the engine.
* What feature/design problem are you most worried about working on? I am worried about making multiple runnable games and accounting for actions like undoing and creating templates.
* What do you plan to implement this weekend? I plan to do whatever it takes so that my group can create the demo required for the Tuesday after break. I don't even mind working on parts of the project I'm not assigned to, as long as they need my help.
* Discuss the use cases/issues created for your pieces: are they descriptive, appropriate, and reasonably sized? The use cases created are appropriate and taken as a group, basically summarize the entire functionality that we're planning to implement for the mid-point demo.
* Do you have use cases for errors that might occur? We have use cases for incorrectly formatted files and input.
